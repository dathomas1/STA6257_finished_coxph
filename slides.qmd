## Overview

-   What is the Cox Proportional Hazards Model?

-   Known for its ability to handle censored data

-   Versatile and can achieve comparable results to its parametric counterparts

## Applications and Limitations

-   Mainly used in medical field

-   While commonly used in medical research, can be applied to other fields, such as finance or social sciences

-   Limitations concerning time dependent variables

## Statistic Model

The composition of the model is as follows:

$$ H(t) = H_0(t) \times exp(b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... + b_kx_k) $$

Where $H_0 (t)$ is considered to be the baseline hazard function of the model. \$ b_k \$ are model parameters.

## Model in R

The Cox PH model in R is ran from the survival package. Below is an example of running the model with a single variable (treat):

```{r}
# Import packages
library(survival)
library(MASS)

# Load Data
data(VA)

# Fit Cox PH Model
Y = Surv(VA$stime, VA$status)
coxph(Y ~ treat, data=VA)
```

## Interpreting R Output

We use the hazard ratio (HR) to determine the effect of test treatment in comparison with the standard treatment:

$$ HR = {h_{test}(t) \over h_{standard}(t)} = {h_0(t)\times exp(0.0177 \times X_{test}) \over h_0(t) \times exp(0.0177 \times X_{standard})} $$ $$ = {exp(0.0177 \times 1) \over exp(0.0177 \times 0)} = 1.018$$ This means that the hazard for the test group is 1.02 times the hazard for the standard treatment group. In order words, the test group has a 1.8% more likely to experience the event than the standard group.

## Proportional Hazard Assumption

The proportional hazard assumption is means that hazard ratio (HR) is constant over time. This means the predictor variables and regression coefficients are time-independent (no change over course of study).

Methods of checking PH assumption

-   Graphical view of regression coefficients residuals

-   Statistical test of residuals

-   Graphical view of log-log survival curve

## Graphical view of regression coefficients residuals

PH assumption is valid when coefficient is constant over time.

Schoenfeld residuals for a variable are the observed value for i-th individual at the "event" time - the weight-average of the variable for other subjects still at risk.

## Statistical test of residuals

Test if Schoenfeld residuals are correlated with time. The null hypothesis $H_0$ is that the residuals are not correlated with time. Rejecting $H_0$ means the PH assumption is violated. In R, use the cox.zph function.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
cox.zph(coxph(Y ~ treat, data=VA), transform = rank)
```

## Graphical view of log-log survival curve

If log-log survival curves are parallel then the PH assumption is appropriate. Since curves cross, PH assumption is violated.

## Options when PH assumption not met

-   Start Cox PH model after certain time period (ie fit model for 180-day survivors)

-   Stratify on the non-proportional variable and obtain separate models for each group

-   Use extended Cox model which allows for time-varying coefficients and/or time-dependent variables

## Multiple Variable Cox Model in R

```{r, echo=TRUE}
coxph(Y ~ treat + age + Karn + diag.time + cell + prior, data=VA)
```

## Checking PH Assumption

```{r, echo=TRUE}
cox.zph(coxph(Y ~ treat + age + Karn + diag.time + cell + prior, data=VA), transform=rank)
```

## Fitting Cox model for 180-day survivors

Only 27 individual left in study after 180 days. Sample too small to make conclusions.

## Stratified Cox model

Assumes a different baseline hazard function for each categorical variable.

$$h_g(t) = {h_{0g}(t)} \times \exp(0.286\text{(treat-test)}-0.012\text{(age)}-0.0383\text{(Karn)}-0.0034\text{(diag.time)}+0.169\text{(prior-no)})$$ where $$g = 1, 2, 3, 4 \text{ (number of cell types)}$$ \## Stratified Cox model in R We the following code for stratifying on cell type.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
coxph(Y ~ treat + age + Karn + diag.time + strata(cell) + prior, data=VA)
```

## Stratified Cox model limitation

-   Continuous variables like Karnofsky score must be grouped to categories.

-   Cannot compare the effect of each cell type on survival using hazard ratios (HR).

## Stratified Cox model with Interaction

The previous stratified Cox model assumed the coefficients did not vary across cell types. To check this assumption, we fit a Cox model with interaction terms for strata.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
coxph(Y ~ treat + age + Karn + diag.time + prior + treat:cell + age:cell + Karn:cell + diag.time:cell +strata(cell) + prior:cell, data=VA)
```

## Likelihood Ratio Test

We can use the Log-Likelihood Ratio Test to determine if there is a significant difference in nested models.

```{r}
cox.modstrat <- coxph(Y ~ treat + age + Karn + diag.time + strata(cell) + prior, data=VA)
cox.modstratI <- coxph(Y ~ treat + age + Karn + diag.time + prior + treat:cell + age:cell + Karn:cell + diag.time:cell +strata(cell) + prior:cell, data=VA)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
anova(cox.modstrat, cox.modstratI, test="LRT")
```

Based on the Log-Likelihood Ratio Test, the no-interaction stratified Cox is sufficient.

## Extended Cox model for Time-Varying Coefficients

$$h_i(t)= h_0(t) \times exp(\beta_i(t)Z_i) $$

Used to specify a function for the coefficients that change with time (linear, logarithmic, a step function, etc).

We used a step function for time intervals of 0-90, 90-180, and 180+ days.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
VA.cp = survSplit(Surv(stime, status)  ~ ., data=VA, cut=c(90,180), episode="tgroup")
```

## Stratified-Extended Cox model

We can both stratify on cell type while using the extended model for the Karnofsky score.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
coxph(Surv(tstart, stime, status) ~ treat + age + diag.time + strata(cell) + prior + Karn:strata(tgroup),
                 data=VA.cp)
```

## Reducing Model with Likelihood Ratio Test

```{r}
cox.modse = coxph(Surv(tstart, stime, status) ~ treat + age + diag.time + strata(cell) + prior + Karn:strata(tgroup),
                 data=VA.cp)
cox.modse_r = coxph(Surv(tstart, stime, status) ~ treat + strata(cell) + Karn:strata(tgroup),
                 data=VA.cp)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Using anova with Likelihood ratio test
anova(cox.modse_r, cox.modse, test="LRT")
```

## Final Stratified-Extended Cox model

Since the difference in Likelihood ratio test is insignificant, we can simplify the model to treat + Karn + cell.

$$h_g(t) = {h_{0g}(t)} \times \exp(0.0988\text{(treat-test)}-0.0464\text{(Karn*tgroup1)}+0.0097\text{(Karn*tgroup2)}-0.0179\text{(Karn*tgroup3)}$$ where $$g = 1, 2, 3, 4 \text{ (number of cell types)}$$ $$tgroup1 = 1 \text{ if  } 0 \le t < 90 $$ $$tgroup2 = 1 \text{ if  } 90 \le t < 180 $$ $$tgroup3 = 1 \text{ if  } t \ge 180$$

## Stratified-Extended Cox model Summary

```{r}
library(gtsummary)
cox.modse_r %>% tbl_regression(exponentiate = T) %>% 
add_glance_table(
  include = c(logLik, concordance)
) %>%
  modify_caption("**Stratified-Extended Cox Model**")
```

## Model Interpretation for Treatment

Using the Stratified-Extended Cox model, a patient on the test treatment is 10% more likely to die than one receiving the standard when adjusting for cell type and Karnofsky's score. However, the treatment results are insignificant.

## Model Interpretation for Karnofsky Score

The model also showed that the probability of dying for a male VA patient with a 1-point lower Karnofsky's score is 5% more likely to die than a patient with a 1-point higher score for the first 90 days. The Karnofsky's scores across the other time intervals are insignificant.

## Conclusion

- Cox Proportional Hazards Model is popular in survival analysis 

- Considered robust, as it can handle censored data

- Can be relied upon as an accurate indicator of risk factors
