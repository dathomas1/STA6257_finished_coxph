## Introduction

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Add Your Slides Separated by two "\##"

Words and text/code go inside. You can save plots locally, .jpg/etc, or access the already made plots. To insert them, go into visual mode (see top left) and then click insert and select the image from there, you can resize in visual mode. See lecture if this doesn't make sense.
